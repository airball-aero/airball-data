This is a plot of the applied versus measured IAS on the end-to-end
Airball probe system, using a water manometer to apply pressure and
reading the IAS off the actual instrument in the airplane.

The results show that the end-to-end system of Airball reports IAS
correctly for a given dynamic pressure.
