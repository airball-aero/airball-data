This is a plot of a series of readings from the Airball probe versus
the ASI installed in N291DR.

For the "probe static" version, the static source installed in the
probe was used. This is a 1/4" brass tube on a 3D printed pylon.

For the "alternate static" version, the static source was a very long
(more than 12") 1/4" acrylic tube, mounted on the strut facing
forwards and quite far (more than 5") from the probe itself.

The results show that (a) the readings of the Airball ASI are quite a
bit lower than the N291DR ASI; and (b) that the choice of static
source does not create a significant difference.
